# When deploying a new version, you can label it deployment: green. 
# It won’t receive any traffic, even when it’s fully up and running, 
# because the Service only sends traffic to blue Pods. 
# You can test it and make sure it’s ready before making the cutover.
# To switch over to the new Deployment, edit the Service to change the selector to
# deployment: green. Now the new green Pods will start receiving traffic, and once all
# the old blue Pods are idle, you can shut them down (or keep them running for easy rollback).
